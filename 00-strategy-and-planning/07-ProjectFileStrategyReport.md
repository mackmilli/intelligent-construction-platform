Project File Strategy Report
This report outlines the purpose and strategy behind each of the core foundation documents located in the 00-strategy-and-planning folder. This structure ensures that all strategic, architectural, and design decisions are documented and accessible before development begins.

1. 01-MasterBlueprint.md
Purpose: To serve as the high-level summary and entry point for the entire project. It contains the project's mission, current status, and a list of all other core documents. Anyone joining the project should start by reading this file.

2. 02-ToolStack.md
Purpose: To provide a comprehensive, single-source-of-truth list of all technologies, software, and services that will be used to build and run the platform. This prevents ambiguity and ensures the development team is aligned on the technical stack.

3. 03-DataDictionarySchema.md
Purpose: To define the exact structure of the database. It details every table, column, data type, and relationship. This document is critical for both backend developers (to build the API) and frontend developers (to understand the data they will receive).

4. 04-UserPersonasJourneyMaps.md
Purpose: To define who we are building this platform for. It describes the different types of users, their goals, and their frustrations. The journey maps outline how each user will interact with the system, ensuring development is user-centric.

5. 05-SystemArchitectureBusinessLogic.md
Purpose: To explain how the system works as a whole. It describes the flow of data from a user's action (like uploading a file) through all the backend components (API, database, workers) to the final result. This is the technical blueprint for the system's core processes.

6. 06-CodeArchitectureStandards.md
Purpose: To define the rules for how the code itself should be written and organized. By enforcing a feature-based architecture and clear naming conventions, this document ensures the codebase remains clean, scalable, and easy to maintain over the long term.

7. 07-ProjectFileStrategyReport.md
Purpose: This very document. It acts as a "map" to the other strategy documents, explaining why each one exists and what its role is in the overall project plan.
