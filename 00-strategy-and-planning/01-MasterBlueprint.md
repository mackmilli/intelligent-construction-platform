Project: Intelligent Construction Analysis Platform
Session Goal
The goal of this initial phase was to analyze an initial set of 16 project files and transform them into a complete, professional, and actionable strategic foundation for development.

Current Status: Strategic Planning Phase Complete
The project is now ready to move into the Design (01-user-experience-design) and Development (02-development) phases.

Final Outcome & Key Decisions
We successfully created a complete project structure and a "Core Foundation" of seven key strategic documents. This foundation is organized, version-controlled, and uses automation-friendly naming conventions.

Core Foundation Documents
The project now revolves around seven essential documents that guide the entire development process:

01-MasterBlueprint.md

02-ToolStack.md

03-DataDictionarySchema.md

04-UserPersonasJourneyMaps.md

05-SystemArchitectureBusinessLogic.md

06-CodeArchitectureStandards.md

07-ProjectFileStrategyReport.md

Adopted Code Architecture
We have formally adopted a feature-based architecture with a strict one-way data flow (App -> Features -> Shared). This will be enforced using ESLint to ensure long-term code quality.
