## How to Contribute

We use a simple feature branch workflow. Please do not push directly to the `main` branch.

1.  **Create a Feature Branch**
    -   Start from the `main` branch. Make sure you have the latest version: `git pull origin main`
    -   Create a descriptive branch name for your new feature or fix. Example: `git checkout -b feature/add-new-visualization` or `fix/correct-calculation-error`

2.  **Make Your Changes**
    -   Do your work on your new branch.

3.  **Commit Your Changes**
    -   Add your changed files: `git add .`
    -   Commit your changes with a clear message: `git commit -m "feat: add new visualization for material tracking"`

4.  **Push to Your Branch**
    -   Push your new branch to the remote repository: `git push origin feature/add-new-visualization`

5.  **Open a Pull Request**
    -   Go to the project's GitHub page.
    -   You will see a prompt to create a Pull Request from your new branch.
    -   Fill out the pull request template and submit it for review.
